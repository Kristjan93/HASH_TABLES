#HASH TABLES
**Info on the assignment:**

   In this project, we will reiterate on the previous project (Skilaverkefni 3) and create a contact manager. But instead of using a binary search tree to implement StringContactMap we will now use hash tables. We make use of the fact that all our classes define abstract data types, so changing the implementation of StringContactMap does not require changing other sections of the program.
   Note that completing skilaverkefni 3 is not a preliminary for the current assignment and that you can use your own implementation of ContactManager, or use the one supplied.
   
   * I have one project that is exactly the same except using [BST](https://github.com/Kristjan93/BINARY_SEARCH_TREES)
